# Dimension theory of algebraic stacks: work on things like
Irreducible components of algebraic stacks, checking that dimension theory works out, etc. A tiny bit of material can be found in [tag 0AFL](http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0AFL) which was contributed by Burt Totaro.


# Coarse moduli spaces for (not necessarily DM) algebraic stacks
Develop the general theory. Some very rudimentary definitions (stated in the language of groupoids) can be found in [tag 048A](http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/048A).


# Limit formalism: Chunks of the limit formalism from EGA IV<sub>3</sub>.
The Stacks project contains some of this material in the chapters

* [tag 01YT](http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01YT)
* [tag 07SB](http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/07SB)
* [tag 0CMM](http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0CMM)

but you can never have enough of this.


# Picard schemes and spaces
The Stacks project has a chapter about Picard schemes for nonsingular projective curves over algebraically closed fields, see [tag 0B92](http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0B92). Filling in the material on Picard schemes / spaces for families of curves is a worthwhile goal.


# Hilbert-Mumford criterion for GIT (semi-)stability.
This can be done in the setting of algebraic stacks (work of Daniel Halpern-Leistner) but the Stacks project first needs to add the classical version.


# Picard stacks
The Stacks project contains algebraicity of the stack of coherent sheaves on a finitely presented algebraic space over a base, see [tag 08WB](http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/08WB). This can be used to prove the algebraicity of many stacks: Quot, Hilb, Pic.


# Semi-stable reduction for abelian varieties
The Stacks project contains semi-stable reduction for curves, see [tag 0C2P](http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0C2P). The project would start with outlining material that would be needed to convert this into a semi-stable reduction theorem for abelian varieties.


# Moduli of complexes a la Lieblich
Without(!) looking at [Max's paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0502198) try to prove that the stack of perfect complexes with vanishing negative Ext groups is algebraic. Checking Artin's axioms is always fun and moreover one can cut up the task into many smaller tasks which can be worked on independently of the others. Moreover, we have a host of machinery (such as Van den
Bergh and Bondal's result that $D_QCoh(X)$ is a module category) available that may be helpful to work around technical problems.


# Artin's theorem on existence of contractions
The Stacks project contains Artin's theorem on dilatations, see [tag 0AR1](http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0AR1). This project would involve working with formal algebraic spaces and checking Artin's axioms in a specific case. As in the previous project, this project can be split into smaller parts, although it takes more time and effort to even describe what the problem is.


# Artin's axioms in examples
Finding (counter)examples illustrating Artin's axioms and their sharpness, based on Artin's ``Implicit function theorem'' and Emerton--Gee's [``Scheme-theoretic images'' of morphisms of stacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06146).
